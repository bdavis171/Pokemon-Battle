# Pokemon-Battle

This is a text based pokemon game where you command Typhlosion, the Volcano Pokemon, against Blastoise, the Shellfish Pokemon. You are given four choices of attacks for Typhlosion to use, and have to type out what attack you wish for it to use.

If you do not have a comiler for C++, you can copy and paste the code here to run it: http://cpp.sh/
